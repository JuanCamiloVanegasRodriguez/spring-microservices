# Microservices Learning Project

This repository is a hands-on project designed to explore and learn about 
microservices architecture. The goal is to understand the fundamental concepts 
of microservices, including service discovery, inter-service communication, and 
the use of tools like Spring Cloud.

The project includes several microservices, each with a specific responsibility, 
interacting with each other to simulate a real-world application. 
It serves as a learning resource for building, deploying, and managing 
microservices-based applications.
